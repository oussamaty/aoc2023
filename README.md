## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants are encouraged to solve it using their programming skills.

## Overview

Throughout Advent of Code 2023, my focus was on developing optimized solutions, with a notable example being the Day 5 Part 2 problem. For this challenge, I employed a top-down approach through range mapping. This strategic optimization not only enabled me to achieve correct solutions but also delivered impressive response times, consistently under 1 millisecond, even in Python. Though it took considerable effort to iron out all the edge cases, the final result is a source of pride in my approach to problem-solving during this event.
